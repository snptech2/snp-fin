## 📊 Business Problem Solved

### Previous Issues
- ❌ **Inconsistent ROI calculations** across different pages
- ❌ **Unclear risk assessment** - couldn't tell how much money was still at risk
- ❌ **Mixed profit types** - no distinction between realized vs potential profits
- ❌ **Poor capital recovery tracking** - unclear when investment was "paid back"

### Enhanced Solution Delivered
- ✅ **Unified calculation logic** across all portfolio types and pages
- ✅ **Clear risk visibility** - exact tracking of money still "at risk"
- ✅ **Separated profit types** - realized profits vs unrealized potential
- ✅ **Capital recovery tracking** - clear view of investment payback status

## 🏆 Key Achievements

### 1. Enhanced Cash Flow Logic Implementation
```
Core Innovation: Universal investment tracking methodology

totalInvested (Historical) → capitalRecovered (From Sales) → effectiveInvestment (At Risk)
                          ↓
              realizedProfit (Real) + unrealizedProfit (Potential) = Total Performance
```

### 2. Cross-Platform Consistency
- **100% identical calculations** between Investments and Accounts pages
- **Unified ROI methodology** across DCA Bitcoin and Crypto Wallet portfolios
- **Type-safe implementation** preventing calculation errors

### 3. Real-World Validation
**Test Portfolio Performance:**
- **testbtc (DCA Bitcoin)**: 70.68% ROI with 100€ still at risk
- **testcrypto (Crypto Wallet)**: 170.00% ROI with 60€ realized profits
- **Overall Portfolio**: 79.71% ROI across 550€ total investment
